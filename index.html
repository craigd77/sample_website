        Hi there! My name is Penny and I was born in California on August 21 2020 to a Golden Retriever and a Poodle, which makes me a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldendoodle">Goldendoodle</a>.

    <h2>Looking For</h2>

    <p>
        I am looking for someone that is fit, energetic, and knows how to swim as I love swimming. I am looking to have three litters, so if you don't want to be a Dad it's best you move along.
    </p>
